# My-Steam-PowerShell-Module
This is a test PowerShell module for getting information from Steam.

It can be used to get information about Steam games, or convert files from the .VDF format Steam uses into a PowerShell .XML object.
This is to support a module that I've written for a game that I play frequently. Future functionality includes converting Steam Controller configuration files into a more readable format.
